In this lesson, you will use Express to create your
own backend to scare your friends. You should start 
by bringing Express into this project using 
the `npm install` command.

Then, in 'index.js', create two routes that handle
GET requests at the `/` and `/boo` paths. Your
Express application should respond to GET requests at
the `/` path by sending a working hyperlink (the link text
can say anything you want) that sends
the user to `/boo` when clicked. Users at the `/boo` 
path should see a scary picture of [ghosts](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/70/Halloween-2870607_1920.jpg/640px-Halloween-2870607_1920.jpg).
